# Intraday Solar Energy Forecasting Report

## Introduction
Solar energy forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing energy usage and grid stability.
The objective of this project is to develop an intraday solar energy forecasting model using
machine learning techniques. The model predicts solar power generation for the next 1 to 6
hours using historical data and weather-related parameters.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of hourly solar energy production along with meteorological features
such as temperature, irradiance, humidity, and wind speed. The training data is used to build
the predictive model, while the test dataset evaluates its performance using MAPE.

## Key Take Away
The approach involves the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and
2. 3. 4. 5. normalization.
Feature Engineering: Creating time-based features such as hour, day, and month,
and transforming cyclic features using sine and cosine transformations.
Model Selection: Using the XGBoost regressor, a powerful gradient-boosting model
optimized for structured data.
Multi-Step Forecasting: Predicting energy output for 1-hour to 6-hours ahead using
separate models.
Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using Mean Absolute Percentage Error
(MAPE) across different time horizons.

## Model Implementation
• Preprocessing: Missing values are imputed using the mean strategy.
• Feature Scaling: Standardization is applied to ensure optimal model performance.
not mandatory for XGBoost but van be use for faster convergence
• Forecasting: Six separate XGBoost models are trained to predict each forecast
horizon.

## Evaluation Metrics
The primary metric used for performance evaluation is MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage
Error):
This metric measures the percentage error between actual and predicted values, providing an
intuitive assessment of model accuracy.
Challenges Faced
1. Zero value in Target: Leading to the huge value in MAPE, so adjusted 0 to 1 (Adj.
2. 3. MAPE)
Multi-Step Forecasting: Predicting multiple time steps ahead required careful
handling of lag features and model dependencies.
Feature Importance: Selecting the most relevant features was crucial to avoid
overfitting and enhance model interpretability.

## Results
• The model demonstrated stable performance across different forecast horizons.
• Monthly MAPE was analyzed to assess seasonal variations.
• Forecast accuracy decreased as the prediction horizon increased, which is expected in
time-series forecasting.

## Conclusion
This project successfully implemented an XGBoost-based forecasting model for intraday
solar energy prediction. The results provide insights into short-term energy generation trends,
aiding energy management decisions.
